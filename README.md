# Raytracing Program

This is a program that I wrote in C/C++ based on Gabriel Gambetta's book, Computer Graphics From Scratch (https://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch/).

The program uses only the DrawPixel() Function from [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) as a primitive and builds upon it to Raytrace shadows, reflections and lighting.

This project uses [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) for its comprehensive structures that are useful for tracing rays (eg. Vectors and Vector Math). GUI functions and Window Drawing functions were also used.
